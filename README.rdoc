= Cms

= Authentication

The cms has no build in authentication.
It uses cancan for authorization, the reset is up to you.

To hook your user into the project you have to create the initializer config/initializers/cms.rb
and add the following code to it:

Cms.user_class = 'Your user class'
Cms.user_roles_attribute = 'your roles method on user'
